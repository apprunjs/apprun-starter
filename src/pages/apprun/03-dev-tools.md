# Dev Tools

There are many development tools that can help you developing AppRun applications with productivity and quality.

## CLI in Console

In additional to the AppRun CLI, AppRun has a script that you can include in the HTML file. It brings up a CLI in the console.

## Redux Extensions

AppRun supports the Redux DevTools Extension. To use the DevTools, install the [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension). Then you can monitor the events and states in the devtools.
