## My AppRun App

Add pages to the directory `pages`; they will be served as static files.

Modify apprun-site.yml to configure your app.

* Use _npm run dev_ to start the dev server
* Use _npm run build_ to build for production

This is an application built with [AppRun Site](https://github.com/yysun/apprun-site).
